## 🎯 Aim

The project aims to optimize the bank's marketing campaigns by providing insights into customer behavior and factors influencing their subscription decisions


## 📌 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can effectively classify whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. This classification model will be based on the provided dataset and a set of features. The model's performance will be evaluated based on various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, to ensure its effectiveness.


## 🧑‍🔬 Scope and Methodology

The scope of this project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation. It will culminate in the creation of a robust predictive model that can forecast whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The methodology follows a data-driven approach, emphasizing the importance of feature selection and model assessment to achieve the best possible predictive performance.

## ✔️📊 Results and Discussion

- Both models exhibit strengths and trade-offs. Logistic Regression outperforms KNN in terms of precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, particularly for Class 1 (subscription).
- Logistic Regression is better at capturing potential subscribers, which might be desirable in a marketing campaign context where identifying potential customers is essential.
- The choice between these models should depend on the specific goals of your marketing campaign. If capturing more subscribers is a priority, Logistic Regression appears to be the better choice. It offers a better balance between precision and recall for Class 1.
- Additionally, Logistic Regression's higher ROC-AUC indicates better overall discriminative power between the two classes.
